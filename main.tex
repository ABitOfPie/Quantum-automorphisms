\chapter*{Abstract}
These notes are made with the (initial) purpose of understanding the required theory to work on quantum groups of automorphisms of matroids. I may constantly find myself rambling on about topics which are not totally necessary for said purpose and I may or may not eventually remove these parts. For now, these reflect my (probably messy) path on understanding topics such as quantum groups, groups of automorphisms and $\cs$-algebras, among other stuff. I will \emph{try} to make this a (mostly) self-contained work, \emph{but I won't be making any promises of such thing}. c:

Also, this are mostly based on several papers I've came across and I will be listing them somewhere in these notes, eventually.
